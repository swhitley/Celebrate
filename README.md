## Sample Data

This is an example of the json format that Celebrate can process.  Celebrate also recognizes the json that is produced by Workday's Reporting as a Service (RaaS).

```json
[
	{
		"group": "5",
		"photo": "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:music:musgottlieb:musgottlieb-00151:ver01:0001/full/pct:25.0/0/default.jpg",
		"name": "Louis Armstrong",
